# Repo template

This is a template repo for personal use with things I usually copy around or write anew repeatedly, kept to a minimum.

More features such as a CUE version may follow here or in specific branches.

## Requirements

A few tools are assumed to be available:

- Podman, or alternatively Docker
- [direnv.net](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)
- [git-cliff.org](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff)
- [just.systems](https://github.com/casey/just)
- Go, optionally

## Usage

Clone and search+replace as necessary.

As for running the placeholder as-is, run

`just`
